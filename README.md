# Apple Website - Clone of old Webpage

> A clone of the an old version of the ["Apple Website webpage"](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

In this project we were required to align all elements using float, flex or grid; the CSS background image in the main section should cover the whole page irrespective of the screen size.

We implemented the use of flexbox for the navbar and grid for the bottom picture links.

This project was a great learning opportunity to implement the use of background images.
